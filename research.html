## Research

I am currently working as a research assistant at <a href="https://www.wis.ewi.tudelft.nl/">WIS group, TU Delft</a> where I am advised by <a href="http://ujwalgadiraju.com/">Prof. Ujwal Gadiraju</a>. I am broadly interested in Human Algorithm Decision Making, and their applications to create a great world. My professional goals are centered around making machine decisions more reliable.
